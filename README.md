# Music-Sharing
A music web application for users to create, search and share songs. As this project only demonstrates database capabilities, note that actual song files are not considered and implemented.

Information is displayed depending on the level of access (Guest, User, or Administrator). Administrators can view, modify and delete user accounts and songs.

Due to time constraints, messages and playlists were not implemented. The project is not yet deployed to a server.
